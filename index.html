        the world around us through altruistic endeavors. There are
        individuals who are hurt, struggling and in pain, and as fellow
        human beings we believe it is our obligation to do all we can to
        help make their lives a little easier. Many of us have been
        blessed with so much, and in order to make true change, we
        should extend those blessings to those who may not be as
        fortunate. One person at a time, step by step, ChariTABLE
        hopes to improve the lives of those in our community, we hope
